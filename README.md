# ComputerShare_Demo

## Introduction
This demo was created to the specification laid out in the computershare practical challenge.
The practical challenge consisted of:

- Reading in 2 CSV files (supplied) consisting of market-opening stock prices from the beginning of each trading day of the last month.
- Determining the best day to buy and sell.

## Work
The development of this demo was undertaken after normal working hours:
- Thursday 26/02/2020: 1730 - 2330
- Friday 27/02/2020: 1500 - 1900
- Saturday 28/02/2020: 1500 - 1700
- Total time: 12 hours*

## Demo Contents
The demo project consists of 2 pages:
- Basic Page: A basic page that fulfills the minimum requrements with no additional functions or features.
- Fancy Page: A page that while fulfilling the requrements for the challenge has implimented some additional features such as mobile optimisation, bootstrap themes and stock market widgets

A DLL was created to hide the process of reading the provided files and the processing of the raw data into a more managble format.

## Things of Note
Most of the noteworthy features are on the Fancy page:
- Bootstrap has been implimented allowing for consistant themeing.
- The page is mobile optimised allowing for a better user experiance on mobile platforms.
- Raw data and processed data for both files appear in modals (popups) instead of being added to the page.
- A calander was made from scratch to allow the processed data to be understood more easily.
- Buy and Sell days are highlighted on the calendar.</li>
- Beggining of day prices are dynamically attached to each  'day' in the calendar and will appear when the user hovers over the day.
- Stock market widgets were added to provide the user with some additional information.**
